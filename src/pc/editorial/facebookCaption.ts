export const FACEBOOK_STYLE = `Facebook caption (the text under the banner picture on the ESB Power Line Page):
- Write like a sharp human news editor, not a bot: plain, specific, active voice. Open with the single most striking fact in the story (a number, a place, a decision), then stop.
- One or two short lines, 125 characters in all, so no "See more" button appears on a phone or a desktop. Never a paragraph.
- No link, and no "read more", "click", "link in comments" or question that baits a click.
- Avoid the giveaways of machine writing: no em dashes, no "Moreover", "landscape", "game-changer", "Here's what", no "BREAKING:", no all-caps words, at most one emoji.
- Use only facts the story states.
- After the text, a blank line, then ONE line of 3 to 5 hashtags: CamelCase, specific to this story and to Bangladesh's energy sector (for example #Bangladesh #LNG #Energy), with #ESBPowerLine last.`
